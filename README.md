# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This analysis provides a review of historic kickstarter campaigns, in order to determine whether there are specific factors that make a crowdfunding campaign successful. Using global crowdfunding data from 2009-2017, this report provides a deep dive into whether launch dates and goal amounts affect the overall success of a campaign. This analysis uses pivot tables, scatter plots, line graphs and data tables to provide an analysis and visualization of the data.
### Purpose
My client, Louise, is a playwright looking to launch a kickstarter campaign to fund her new play, Fever. She would like to understand which factors influenced the success of previous theater campaigns, so she can set herself up for success! Her estimated budget is $10,000 and Louise would like to use the results of this analysis, to inform the creation of her own campaign.
